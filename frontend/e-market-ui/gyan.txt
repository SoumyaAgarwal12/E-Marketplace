Install React
    npx create-react-app <application_name>

cd <application_name>

We have main files in 'src' folder - "App.js"(starting point)

Run "npm start" in terminal 

Routing - 
    Install Routing package in <application_name> folder 
        i.e. npm i react-router-dom 


Links for our Routes
    - import { Link } from react-router-dom
    - When we use "Link", then we need to write our component insite "BrowserRouter" tag.
        - For this we need to import "BrowserRouter" i.e. 
            import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

Note :
    - Don't use anchor tag. Otherwise page will refresh.
    - Instead of anchor tag for our links, we use "Link" from react-router-dom package.
