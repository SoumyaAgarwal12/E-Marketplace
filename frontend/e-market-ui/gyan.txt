Install React
    npx create-react-app <application_name>

cd <application_name>

We have main files in 'src' folder - "App.js"(starting point)

Run "npm start" in terminal 

Routing - 
    Install Routing package in <application_name> folder 
        i.e. npm i react-router-dom 


Links for our Routes
    - import { Link } from react-router-dom
    - When we use "Link", then we need to write our component insite "BrowserRouter" tag.
        - For this we need to import "BrowserRouter" i.e. 
            import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'

Note :
    - Don't use anchor tag. Otherwise page will refresh.
    - Instead of anchor tag for our links, we use "Link" from react-router-dom package. 

Routes (page for our links) :
    - For this we need to import "Routes" i.e. 
            import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom'
    - Write our routes in "Routes" tag i.e.
        <Routes>
            <Route path="/" element = {<h1>Home Page Component</h1>} />       // element attr takes component 
        </Routes>

Note :-
    "Link to" and "path" attr should be same. 
    If we are using routing in any component then call that component under "BrowserRouter" tag otherwise we can call from outsite like footer component. 

Input Fields :-
    - For getting values in input fields we use "useState" i.e.
        import {useState} from 'react'

Note :-
    - The React 'useState' Hook allows us to track state in a function component.

For CORS Error :-
    - Install npm package : npm install cors
    - Include and use 'cors' package i.e. 
            app.use(cors());

For Navigation from one page to other :-
    - import {useNavigate} from 'react-router-dom
    - const navigate = useNavigate()
    - navigate("/")          // Redirect to Home Page
